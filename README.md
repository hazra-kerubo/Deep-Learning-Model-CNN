# Deep-Learning-Model-CNN

Introduction 

Music genre classification is the process where a piece of music is recognized, understood and differentiated by a conventional category as belonging to a shared traditions set of conventions. In this project we are interested in working on genre detection as a probabilistic distribution of various genres as The dataset used for this project is GTZAN Music Genre Classification from kaggle.

This project aims at developing a deep learning project to automatically classify different musical genres from audio files. We will classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain. For this project we need a dataset of audio tracks having similar size and similar frequency range.

There are 10 classes ( 10 music genres) each containing 100 audio tracks. Each track is in .wav format. It contains audio files of the following 10 genres:
Blues
Classical
Country
Disco
Hiphop
Jazz
Metal
Pop
Reggae
Rock

Goals of our Analysis

Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. 
To build a deep learning model to  automatically classify music into different genres can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. 
In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals.
